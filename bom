#!/bin/bash

# the path to all our git binaries
GITPATH=/usr/lib/git-core

# the path to the directory for our .git directory
# for now assume current directory.. later we will traverse up the tree until we find it
GITDIR=.bom

### ok.. so.. what commands do we need.
# we need: 
# - init
# - add
# - rm
# - show
# - log
# - commit


# - store files named by refdes?  partnumber?  hrmmm refdes makes more sense.
# - refdes must be unique.
# - we could have two types of git objects.  
# 1) refdes.  Contains a ditributor and partnumber that is used to populate that component
# 2) part number. contains all the info about the part.
# - we should probably put these in seperate directories
#		- refdes/
#		- digikey/
#		- some other distributor we support/


### typical workflow
# bom init # setup new db
# bom import foo1.sch foo2.sch foo3.sch  # import the netlists of these schematics
# bom add [ refdes ] ATTINY2313-20SU-ND  # add this part
# bom rm [ refdes | partnum ]  # remove this part
# bom commit # commit these change to the bom
# bom show # show a current revision of a bom
# bom log # show history of bom
# bom diff # show differences between revisions
# bom mv # rename a part?  hrmmm maybe


### what typical stuff will we need to do that aren't git commands?
# bom refresh [ partnumber | refdes ]
# - updates the data from digikey for the listed partnumber or refdes
# bom tabulate [ quantity ]
# - calculates the total cost of the bom at the quantity specified
# bom import <path to netlist/schematic>
# - gets the list of refdes's from the schematic, and imports them into our database
# bom 


### We're also going to need some plumbing commands
# bom-parse-digikey <partnum>
# - fetchs the page for a digikey part number and grabs the info we care about from it
# - it will write to output in our standard object format for holding parts


# do some really basic arg parsing
